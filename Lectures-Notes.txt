Notes:

JSX is a tool that allows writing html and javascript 
example const element = <p> ok! </p>  babel does all the work for us

it is possible to write react without JSX, but will look verbosed and hard to understand

Always remember to close your tag

You cannot return multiple elements, you should wrap everything in a div 

BABEL is a JavaScript Compiler


PROPS:
props are for configuring your component
props are immutable
props can be strings
for ther types, embed JS expression using the curly braces: salary={100} hobbies:{["dancing", "reading"]}

components can specify default values for missing props
