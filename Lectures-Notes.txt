Notes:

JSX is a tool that allows writing html and javascript 
example const element = <p> ok! </p>  babel does all the work for us

it is possible to write react without JSX, but will look verbosed and hard to understand

Always remember to close your tag

You cannot return multiple elements, you should wrap everything in a div 

BABEL is a JavaScript Compiler


PROPS:
props are for configuring your component
props are immutable
props can be strings
for ther types, embed JS expression using the curly braces: salary={100} hobbies:{["dancing", "reading"]}

components can specify default values for missing props


to create react app
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app

npm start //to start your app

CONVENTIONS
each component goes in a separe file and capitalized
example: src/Person.js, src/Pet.js

components extends componento imported from react

the top object is App, you can change it, but it is assumed by skeleton

make a cdd file for each react component
import it st the top of the componenet
conventiona to addd className="NameComponent"
